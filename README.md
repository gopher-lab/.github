## Gopher Chain

Gopher is a sovereign-layer 1 blockchain - the truth layer for the AI economy. An emissions-driven ecosystem where data providers and builders are rewarded for contributing value.

-   **Sovereign layer-1:** A high-performance blockchain built on Cosmos SDK, giving us speed, security, and scalability with a battle-tested framework.
-   **Emission-driven economy:** A self-sustaining data economy powered by emissions. Emissions act as a decentralized capital allocation engine, bootstrapping the network.
-   **Emission flywheel:** Governance directs rewards to the highest-value data providers and apps.
-   **Hardware-level proof:** Trusted Execution Environments (TEE) generate cryptographic proof of data provenance — an unbroken chain of custody from source to model.

## Gophernets

Gophernets are modular networks on Gopher Chain - where data providers and builders compete for emissions. Rewards flow to the apps, data sources and agents driving the most usage and value.

### Builders

Gophernets are for any AI, app, or agent builder who wants to build or use our data and earn emissions. All projects are welcome - including those with their own platform or blockchain.

### Data providers

Gophernets also power rewards for data providers. We invite you to provide unique and valuable data streams to the Gopher ecosystem and earn emissions.

## Trusted Execution Environment

Gopher’s layer-1 blockchain and Bittensor Subnet 42 use secure Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) technology. TEE creates an isolated, secure environment where code can run completely protected and secure.

By leveraging hardware-level security enclaves, Gopher delivers high-quality, verifiable data with minimal latency and industry-leading security guarantees.

### Benefits of TEE

-   **Enhanced Data Privacy:** All data processing occurs in an encrypted enclave.
-   **Verifiable Data:** Cryptographically verified unmodified code processing.
-   **Tamper-Proof Execution:** Even system administrators cannot access or modify data inside the TEE.
-   **Secure Key Management:** Cryptographic keys and sensitive credentials are protected within the enclave.
